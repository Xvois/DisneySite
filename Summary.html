        <p>Whilst Disney may not be the most valuable company on the planet, it certainly has a claim to be the most influential. Its reach now extends far beyond its original sphere of entertainment and now exists in news, sports, airlines, and even child care. Yet, none of this would've been possible without the forethought, planning and insight of a great team of people who used numbers and models to guide the decisions they made.</p>
        <p>The dream of Disney has far outgrown what one Walt Disney conveived of in the early 1920s, and it shows no sign of stopping any time in its future.</p>

    <h1>A depreciating Disney?</h1>
    <h2>Disney's fall into prioritising quantity, and how it saved their business.</h2>
    <p>Disney has long been a titan in the entertainment industry, however their rate of production has not so long been a hallmark of their company - in fact, it was only in the 1980s when the Disney Picture's Studio itself began producing more than 3 or so feature films per year [a figure shown by the area graph starting in 1937]. Their ability to produce quarterly films proved fiscally advantagous for the still small company, allowing them to grow and eventually incorporate in 1986. This move proved decisive for the now company, as it ushered in a new era of development, and of entertainment as a whole.</p>
    <p>Following their incorporation, Disney's pool of funds were immensely deepened causing them to expand on an unprecedented scale and produce a record number of feature films. The graph shows Disney's releases as individual dots, with their heights representing their inflation adjusted revenue - this representation of the data clearly highlights a correlation between the number of releases per year and their individual revenue, which suggests that Disney was prioritising the quantity of their products over its quality in an early attempt to please pioneer investors. Yet, this isn't even close to the common consenus. In fact, this era is coined as the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Renaissance" style="z-index: 10;">Disney Renaissance</a>; an era defined by it's critical and general acclaim, as well as its immense commercial success for Disney.</p>
    <p>This time gave Disney a great amount of pliability to develop and experiment with new IPs while they had the attention of both their investors and the public, allowing them to forge out a secure future for the company. The faith and trust instilled by Disney's ability to produce such high quality films at that extraordinary rate saw the stock price rapidly increase [shown starting at their incorporation - hover over to highlight], allowing the company to become the titan it is today.</p>
